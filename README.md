Electric Vehicle dataset analysis 
'''
For my data analysis project, I chose to investigate electric vehicle populations and their usage in the state of Washington. I chose to explore this topic
because electric vehicles are an expanding market, as there has been a noticeable global shift towards more sustainable transportation in recent years. As a
society, we are starting to place a strong value on green technology and cleaner alternatives to products that may cause significant environmental harm. Electric
vehicles are rapidly emerging in the automotive industry due to their lack of carbon emissions and their independence from the use of fossil fuels. Along with this,
the use of an electric vehicle tends to be more cost-effective in the long run as users save on rising gas prices. The advancement of electric vehicle usage not
only lessens our environmental impact on the atmosphere but also integrates renewable energy that decreases our reliance on finite resources in a cost-effective and
convenient manner. As electric vehicle technology continues to advance, we will see that this type of automotive engineering will grow and demand and quickly become
 more common on our streets.

In this project, I am using a data set, sourced from Kaggle,  that records electric vehicle usage in the state of Washington. The data includes information on:

VIN (1-10): (first ten characters of the Vehicle Identification Number)
County of registration
City where the vehicle is located.
State where the vehicle is registered.
Postal Code of the vehicle's location.
Model Year of the vehicle model.
Make of the vehicle.
Model of the vehicle.
Electric Vehicle Type (e.g., PHEV, BEV).
CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) Eligibility status.
Electric Range of the vehicle.
Base MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
Legislative District associated with the vehicle.
DOL (Department of Licensing) Vehicle ID
Geographic location of the vehicle.
Electric Utility associated with the vehicle.
2020 Census Tract information for the year 2020.

Using this data, I will be exploring the population of electric vehicles and their usage patterns in the state of Washington. Through this exploration, my goal is
to provide an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the electric vehicle market in this population to show how this growing market is evolving the automotive
industry.

→ Understanding the Demographic ←
To explore this data,  we need to understand the demographic of people that we are observing. The total population of the state of Washington is 7,705, 281.
The median household income sits much higher than the national average of $91,306, with about 39.5% of the population holding a bachelor's degree or higher.
From this information, we can see that the overall population of Washington tends to be on the wealthier side of the class Spectrum. In association with our topic
 of electric vehicles, we can understand that a large population of people in Washington own electric vehicles due to their higher average income.

→ Questions of analysis: ←
To explore the data we need to ask questions about how certain pieces of information relate to each other. The questions I will be exploring throughout this
project are:
1. Which cities have the most electric vehicle registrations?
2. What is the average value of the electric ranges? What is the highest and lowest range, and what is the corresponding Make and Model of these values?
3. Which automotive companies make up Washington’s Electric Vehicle population?
4. How many Electric Vehicles in Washington are Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligible or Not eligible due to low battery range?
5. What percentage of electric vehicles in the dataset are eligible as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles?
6. What is the growth of electric vehicle populations in Washington over time?

I will be analyzing the data set and translating it into visualizations and reports in the form of graphs charts and calculations.  I will provide an answer
and a breakdown of statistical proof for each of these questions so that we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the electrical vehicle market in Washington.
